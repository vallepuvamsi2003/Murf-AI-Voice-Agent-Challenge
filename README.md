I created a Fraud Alert Voice Agent for a fictional bank that can detect suspicious activity and guide a customer through a safe verification flow.
🔐 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭
 Using my existing voice agent setup, I created a mini fraud-detection system powered by a fake database of suspicious transactions. The agent:
 ✔ Introduces itself as the bank’s fraud department
 ✔ Loads a fraud case when the call starts
 ✔ Verifies the customer through safe, non-sensitive questions
 ✔ Reads out the suspicious transaction
 ✔ Asks whether the user actually made that payment
 ✔ Marks the case as safe or fraudulent
 ✔ Updates the database with final status + outcome notes

I built a Food & Grocery Ordering Voice Assistant—a smart, voice-powered shopping companion inspired by platforms like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, BigBasket, Blinkit and more.
This agent can help users order groceries, snacks, prepared foods… all using just their voice 🎤✨
