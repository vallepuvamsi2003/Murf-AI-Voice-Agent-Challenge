𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟏 – "𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐑𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠" AI Voice Agent by Murf AI

🔧 What I built Python backend integrated with the Murf AI Speech API Lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend Browser-based voice interaction with real-time audio responses Successfully connected, tested, and had a short conversation with the agent 🎤🤖

I transformed the starter voice agent into a friendly coffee shop barista, trained under the fictional brand Falcon Coffee. The agent now: ✅ Greets customers warmly like a real barista ✅ Takes voice-based coffee orders ✅ Asks clarifying questions until the order is complete ✅ Maintains a structured order state:

{ "drinkType": "", "size": "", "milk": "", "extras": [], "name": "" } ✅ Automatically saves the final order into a JSON file for processing/analytics Seeing the agent guide the conversation, confirm preferences, and generate a clean order summary felt like building a tiny Starbucks AI — and I loved it! ☕✨ Next up: pushing this further into a smarter, faster, more human-like ordering experience.

Today’s build was all about empathy, consistency, and meaningful interaction. I created a daily wellness-focused voice agent that checks in like a supportive companion—without trying to be a clinician.

💡 What the Agent Does

✅ Conducts short daily voice check-ins

✅ Asks about mood, energy, and stress levels

✅ Helps users set 1–3 realistic goals for the day

✅ Offers simple, actionable, non-medical suggestions

✅ Recaps the conversation to reinforce clarity & intention

🧠 Memory + Personalization

Every session is logged into a wellness_log.json file that stores:

Timestamp

Reported mood

Daily objectives



𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟒 – 𝐌𝐮𝐫𝐟 𝐀𝐈 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞: 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡-𝐭𝐡𝐞-𝐓𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫 – 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐂𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡

Today’s build was all about tapping into one of the most powerful learning principles: “the best way to learn is to teach.”
For Day 4, I turned the voice agent into an Active Recall Coach that helps learners master concepts using three interactive modes — each powered by different Murf Falcon voices to create an immersive experience.
🎙️ 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬:
🔹 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞 – The agent explains a concept using Murf Falcon Voice: Matthew.
 🔹 𝐐𝐮𝐢𝐳 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞 – It asks quick questions to test understanding using Alicia.
 🔹 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡-𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞 – It prompts the learner to teach the concept back and gives qualitative feedback using Ken.
📘 Powered by a Simple JSON Content File
I built a small course content file containing concepts like:
Variables
Loops
This file drives the entire learning flow — explanations, quiz prompts, and teach-back questions.
